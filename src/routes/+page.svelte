	<h1>Hello!</h1>
	<p class="">
		I am a software developer and managing director of a Disability Support Service Provider in
		Sydney Australia ðŸ‘‹
	</p>

	<p>
		Iâ€™m lucky enough to manage a team of 60 staff, enabling access to the community and providing
		support to more than 80 NDIS participants.
	</p>

	Iâ€™ve developed tools for our company to:
	<ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
		{#each list as item}
			<li>
				{item}
			</li>
		{/each}
	</ul>
	<p>â€¦ all with Google workspace for zero cost :)</p>

	<p>
		I'm studying a Graduate Diploma of Information Technology at UNE (2025-2026), playing with
		around in Sveltekit, and working on my <a class="underline" href="/projects">projects</a> :)
