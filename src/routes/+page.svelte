	<h1>Hello!</h1>
	<p class="">
		I am a software developer and managing director of a Disability Support Service Provider in Sydney
		Australia ðŸ‘‹
	</p>

	<p>
		Iâ€™m lucky enough to manage a team of 60 staff, enabling access to the community and providing
		support to more than 80 NDIS participants.
	</p>

	Iâ€™ve developed tools for our company to:
	<ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
		{#each list as item}
			<li>
				{item}
			</li>
		{/each}
	</ul>
	â€¦ all with Google workspace for zero cost :)
