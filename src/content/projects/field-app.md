## Purpose

This app is a prototype for a web app for care workers to manage their shifts, submit reports, view client information and other information.

## Features

- Auth
- CRUD with filtering

## Background

The NDIS support market is price controlled.

As a provider, you have to balance your values, the needs of your participants (Clients) and staff retention against the bottom line.

In our case, to slow staff turnover, stick to our values and provide familiar staff to our participants, we made the decision to pay our staff above the bottom of the pay scale by default.

This turned out to be the right decision in our start-up phase, but this also put a lot of pressure on the bottom line.

As I researched software for NDIS providers, I learned that in most cases the cost scaled based on number of users.

This would be feasible for a 24/7 support business, but the majority of our direct revenue generating activity was on Fridays, weekends, and school holiday periods.

Care Culture would be required to scale heavily, changing the business model and purpose, and we would still be fighting the user cost scaling issue.

So I decided to give it a crack myself and built this prototype!
