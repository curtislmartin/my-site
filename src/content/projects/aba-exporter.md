## Background

A couple of years ago I read the Barefoot Investor (like everyone else!), and started to think about using different accounts to manage my finances.

I finished my budget and spent some time sending money around to the different accounts.

This began labourious and annoying quickly.

Then I discovered ABA files!

It took some time to get the formatting perfect, but this is the tool I built :)
